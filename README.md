### A Novel Hash Function-based Fragile Watermarking Method for Image Integrity ~ May '22 (Advanced Computer Vision Course)
Implemented the paper *A novel hash function based fragile watermarking method for image integrity by Ertugrul Gul & Serkan Ozturk*. The procedure involved dividing an image into 32x32 blocks, and then further dividing each block into 16x16 sub block. A 256-bit hash value of the first three sub-blocks are calculated and it is embedded into the Least Significant Bits of the fourth sub-block. The watermarks are verified for content authentication by obtaining the LSBs of the fourth sub-block. <br/>
**Tool used: MATLAB**

### Object Detection using MASK-RCNN and Transfer Learning ~ Apr '21 (Deep Learning Course)
This project involved manually annotating, and training a classifier to identify text on images of several passports and CNICs for identification information. The annotation accuracies were measured using Intersection-over-Union. The trained weights were then saved in h5py format and reused for testing images, exhibiting an effective use of transfer learning.<br/>
**Tools used: Python, Keras and h5py**

### Watermarking of chest CT scan medical images for content authentication ~ Dec '20 (Applied Image Processing Course)
Implemented the paper *Watermarking of chest CT scan medical images for content authentication by Memon, N. A., & Gilani, S. A. M. (2011)* in order to embed watermarks into CT Scans of lung parenchyma. This helps with authentication. The process involved segmenting images into ROI and RONI and scrambling the data in ROI to place a watermark before unshuffling, The project concluded with the suggestion that image compression can tamper the watermark.<br/>
**Tool used: MATLAB**

### Eigenfaces for Recognition ~ Nov '20 (Stat. & Math. Methods in Data Science Course)
Implemented the paper *Eigenfaces for Recognition by Turk and Pentland (1991)* to demonstrate the use of PCA as a means of dimensionality reduction for high dimensional images. The project aimed to build a classifier to identify a set of matching distributions after removing highly covarying data from the dataset. Identical facial images were reconstructed from the given test sample. The classifier achieved a testing error of 34% using just 80 principal components.<br/>
**Tools used: Python, Numpy, Matplotlib and Sklearn**<br/>
