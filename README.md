### Eigenfaces for Recognition (Fall Semester 2020)
Implemented the paper *Eigenfaces for Recognition by Turk and Pentland (1991)* to demonstrate the use of PCA as a means of dimensionality reduction for high dimensional images. The project aimed to build a classifier to identify a set of matching distributions after removing highly covarying data from the dataset. Identical facial images were reconstructed from the given test sample. The classifier achieved a testing error of 34% using just 80 principal components.<br/>
**Tools used: IPython, Numpy, Matplotlib, Sklearn**
